## `lastversion` public API

You don't need to use `lastversion` as a command line tool or install it as a 
package to use it. 

You can consume `lastversion` functionality through **two** API offerings:

1. **Free Public API** at `lastversion-api.getpagespeed.com`  
2. **Production-Ready Commercial API** on [RapidAPI](https://rapidapi.com/ciapnz/api/lastversion)

### 1. Public API (Limited, Best for Small Usage)

**Free API has Limited SLA and Rate Limits:** Itâ€™s free, so heavier usage or production traffic may see performance 
or reliability constraints. For use in automated workflows, we highly recommend the commercial API below.

For casual or small usage scenarios, you can directly query this free public endpoint: 

    https://lastversion-api.getpagespeed.com/<github-repo>

Make a GET request to the endpoint to get the latest version of the repository in JSON format.

To get only the version number, append `?version` to the URL.

Examples:

* [https://lastversion-api.getpagespeed.com/dvershinin/lastversion](https://lastversion-api.getpagespeed.com/dvershinin/lastversion)
* [https://lastversion-api.getpagespeed.com/dvershinin/lastversion?version](https://lastversion-api.getpagespeed.com/dvershinin/lastversion?version)

Note that API caches results for 2 hours.

For faster updates of your own project, please set up a webhook for your 
GitHub repo that points to:

    https://lastversion-api.getpagespeed.com/hooks/github

#### Badges with the latest version

You can use the following badges in your project's `README.md` to show the latest version of your project:

```markdown
![Dynamic JSON Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/dynamic/json?url=https%3A%2F%2Flastversion-api.getpagespeed.com%2Fdvershinin%2Flastversion&query=version&label=Release)
```

Just replace `dvershinin` and `lastversion` with your GitHub username and repository name.

The result will look like this:

![Dynamic JSON Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/dynamic/json?url=https%3A%2F%2Flastversion-api.getpagespeed.com%2Fdvershinin%2Flastversion&query=version&label=Release)

Alternatively, head to [Shields.io dynamic page configurator](https://shields.io/badges/dynamic-json-badge):

* Set URL to `https://lastversion-api.getpagespeed.com/<your-github-user>/<your-github-repo>`
* Set query to `version`
* Set label to `Release` or whatever you want, and set other settings as desired.

Click `Execute` to verify results and copy Markdown or desired format.
