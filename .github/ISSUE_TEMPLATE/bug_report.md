**Current scope and support**

Thank you for submitting this issue/request! ðŸŒŸ

Currently, my focus is on maintaining and enhancing features critical to GitHub releases. 
Fetching a release version from other sources is not a priority at the moment, neither supplementary feature like
zipball/tarball download, etc.

If your particular issue/feature/enhancement falls outside those priorities, and you believe this feature is important and would like to see it developed sooner, there are a few ways to help:

- **Contribute:** We welcome pull requests!
- **Donate:** If you're not able to contribute code but still want to support the addition of this feature, consider making a donation. Donations help prioritize and fund development efforts on features outside my current scope. [Donate here](https://github.com/sponsors/dvershinin).

Your support is greatly appreciated, and any contribution, be it code or donation, helps make `lastversion` better for everyone. ðŸš€
